I wanted to draw triangles.

This program does it fo me.

It is simple. It takes a triangle and divides it into two right triangles. It them repeats this for the sub triangles. And again. And again. Eventually, it makes some pretty cool shapes. Try cloning the repository and opening index.html with your favorite web browser (tested on Chrome).

If you want to dig into the code, it's all in main.js. quickdraw.js is just a framework file that makes it easy to draw.
